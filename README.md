# Deep-Learning-for-Predicting-Quantitative-Phenotypes-from-Genotypes 🧬💻🔬💡⚙️ ⌨️
In this repository you will find all the contecnt related to my **Bachelor Thesis (TFG)**: "Deep Learning and its Application to Predicting Quantitative Phenotypes from Genomic Data". This work is a bibliographic review accompanied by a naive deep learning model in which the theoretical concepts discussed in the manuscript are showed in a practical manner. The objective of the practical work is to serve as educational material, but it may also function as an introductory resource for DL application in genomics research.
