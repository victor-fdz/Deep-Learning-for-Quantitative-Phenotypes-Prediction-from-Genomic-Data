# Deep-Learning-for-Predicting-Quantitative-Phenotypes-from-Genotypes 🧬💻
In this repository you will find all the content related to my **Bachelor's Thesis (TFG)** 💡: "*Deep Learning and its Application to Predicting Quantitative Phenotypes from Genomic Data*". This work is a **bibliographic review** accompanied by a **naive deep learning model** ⚙️ in which the theoretical concepts discussed in the manuscript are showed in a practical manner. The objective of the practical work is to serve as **educational material**, but it may also function as an **introductory resource** for DL application ⌨️ in genomics research.

- 📄 `Manuscript.pdf`: theoretical work.
- 📄 `Poster.pdf`: A0 poster used in the defense of the TFG.

## 📁 `Practical_Example`
- 📄 `DL_Example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the example model.
- 📄 `Environment_DL.yml`: conda environment with the required packages. 
- 📄 `model_saved.keras`: model in itself extracted from the example.
- 📄 `sequences_data.csv`: simulated data generated in the example.
